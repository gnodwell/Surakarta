## Installation :gear:

### Versions :gem:
We use:
- Ruby 2.5.5
- Rails 6.17
- Node 16.17.0

```diff 
- Having these versions installed on your machine is a requirement
```

### System dependencies :hammer:
To install dependencies, simply change the current directory to 'Surakarta' and run:

```
bundle config --local disable_platform_warnings true
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

### Configuration :screwdriver:

#### Update Yarn :yarn:
```
yarn add â€“check-files
```

#### Install webpacker :space_invader:
```
rails webpacker:install
```
This will take a few minutes...

### Creating the Players & Migrate the DB :computer:
First migrate the database with:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

Then seed the db:

```bash
rails db:seed
```

Two users must be created using the rails console. This can easily be done by using the following commands.

To open the rails console, simply use:

```rails
rails c
```

Then use this to create the players:

```rails
player1 = User.new :name => "Player1"
player2 = User.new :name => "Player2"
player1.save()
player2.save()
```

## Running the server :runner:

To run the server, simply run the command:
```
rails server -d -p xxxx -b 0.0.0.0
```

Where "xxxx" is the port number.

For our port, you can run:

```bash
rails server -d -p 33030 -b 0.0.0.0
```

## Troubleshooting
Remove the 'node_modules' directory and 'yarn.lock' file.
Run ```yarn```

To get out of the ```rails:db``` or ```rails c``` simply use ```command + d``` or ```control + d```
